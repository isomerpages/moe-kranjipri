**Plant Morphology :** 

**Growth Form**: A soft and not woody creeping groundcover, commonly found growing as a weed rather than a garden plant. It has a sprawling or weakly climbing habit, and tends to grow into dense mats that smother neighbouring vegetation.

**Foliage**: Leaves are green, sparsely hairy, opposite, smooth-edged, and egg-shaped to broadly lanceolate in shape (8 cm long, 4 cm wide).

**Flowers**: The flowers are in small, one-sided racemes at the stem tips, with the flowers at the bottom of the raceme opening first. The individual flowers are tubular, white, up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, and have 5 rounded lobes, purple, vein-ridged markings on the lower lip, and 4 stamens. This species is free-flowering.  

**Fruits**: Explosively dehiscent fruits known as capsules are initially green, but becomes brown and dry after dehiscence (3.6 cm long). The fruit resembles an upside down cello and contains 4 whitish to brownish black, circular seeds which are flattened and beaked (5 mm long, 1 mm thick). Fruits contain 3 mm-long hooks which help to propel the seeds further away from the plant during explosive dehiscence.

**Habitat** :  
In Australia, this species is considered invasive and a serious threat to native ecosystems.

**Associated Fauna** :

**Cultivation :**  
This fast-growing species grows best under semi-shade or full shade, but plants grown in full sun require sufficient moisture. It is tolerant of many soil types, but optimal growth occurs in well-drained, but moist soils that are rich in compost. Individuals should be spaced 0.45 - 0.6 m apart. This species can grow aggressively and should be restrained with pruning. Propagate by seed, stem cuttings or layering.

**Etymology :**  
The genus "_Asystasia_" means inconsistency, referring to radially symmetrical flowers in this genus which is uncommon in the family Acanthaceae. The species epithet "_gangetica_" was named after the Ganges River in India. This species was likely observed near the Ganges River.
