<p>
Welcome to Kranji Primary School! My colleagues and I have spent much time and effort to put together the content that you see on our website, which showcases the unique value propositions and rich programmes of our school. We have also included information about the relocation of the school to Tengah, to provide a taster of the exciting chapter ahead for the school.

**Nurturing Future-Ready Learners**

<p>Kranji Primary School is committed to provide a forward-looking learning experience in the school so that all our students can be future-ready at the end of their six years with us. The KPS Total Curriculum Framework provides a coherent overview of the school's collective efforts to nurture future-ready learners. At the heart of the Framework is the vision of the school to nurture Joyful Learners, Gracious Citizens and Champions in Life. In order to deliver our vision, the four core attrivutes of Values, Skills, Knowledge and Attitudes that eery Kranjian needs to have are defined. You can read more about it on our dedicated webpage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kranjipri.moe.edu.sg/our-curriculum/total-curriculum-framework/introduction/">here. </a>
</p>
  

Central to the Kranji Experience are our key programmes, including the&nbsp;**1:1 Learning Experience**&nbsp;that provides all our P4 &amp; P6 students with an iPad for learning, our&nbsp;**Applied Learning Programme (ALP)** that focuses on&nbsp;**Nurturing Joyful Learners through Critical and Inventive Thinking**, as well as our **Learning for Life Programme (LLP**) that focuses on&nbsp;Developing Champions in Life through Sports.

&nbsp;The school is focused on creating a learning environment which is student-centric and focuses on student ownership and agency. To enable this, the school has introduced the **CHAMPS Leadership Programme**, which is targeted at building in students self-leadership which is critical for nurturing future-ready learners. Embedded into the programme are key lessons on Executive Functioning skills, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and Growth Mindset messages. My Passion Project (MPP) is a unique platform for our Kranjians to apply their leadership skills onto an area of passion. Through MPP, the school provides opportunities for student voice and ownership and encourages our students to explore their interest.

The school leverages on multiple community and industry partners to bring authentic learning experiences to our students. The school has formed a partnership with an industry partner, EM Services, to bring about authentic learning experiences for our students during Project Work. Students will go on learning journeys, facilitated by EM Services, to get an authentic experience of how science concepts are applied in the real world. The school has also tapped on expertise from the National Institute of Education, as well as the Academy of Singapore Teachers to co-design lesson packages with our teachers in the areas of educational technology and assessment. To develop global awareness and cross-cultural skills in our Kranjians, we have tied up with schools in Malaysia, China and Vietnam to bring the world to Kranji, and to bring our Kranjians to the world through overseas trips.

All of the above, in our belief that Every Kranjian Matters and Deserves the Best, and our commitment to provide the best all-rounded education to your child that is in tune with the times.&nbsp;

  

**Culture of Care**

To support the above, Kranji Primary has a strong culture of care.&nbsp; We value every child who comes to us, regardless of ability and background, and believe that every student wants to succeed, and that all can learn.&nbsp; We have dedicated and experienced teachers and para-educators here in Kranji Primary who provide holistic care to our students beyond the academic. Each form class is supported by two form teachers. We have dedicated Year Heads who look after the Lower, Middle and Upper Primary levels respectively, and specialists who include a Senior School Counsellor and Special Educational Needs Officer. Our teachers work very closely with parents and specialists to provide the best care to each of our Kranjians, to support them in their holistic growth.

  

**Achievements**

Since 2020, we have seen a string of achievements in the student and staff domains.&nbsp; My colleagues achieved various national-level awards like Outstanding&nbsp;Youth in Education Award, LEAP Award,&nbsp;Fellow of Academy of Singapore Teachers Award,&nbsp;National Day Award Commendation Medals and Long Service Medals, and MOE Service Excellence Awards.&nbsp; &nbsp;Concurrently, they are leaders in the fraternity with sharings at various national seminars and conferences in the areas of Math, Project Work, Malay Language and Chinese Language.&nbsp; This is testament to the quality educators that we have in our midst at Kranji Primary School.&nbsp; On the student front, we have achievements across multiple fronts including Math Olympiads, academic competitions,&nbsp;National School Games Basketball Championships,&nbsp;Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation (International Dance &amp; Visual Arts).&nbsp; Follow this [link](https://kranjipri.moe.edu.sg/life-at-kranji/achievements/student-and-school-achievement/) for a list of our school achievements.
