##### **Curricular Objective**

The Junior Tinkering Programme is part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme, which aims to nurture joyful learners who are critical and inventive thinkers.  Through varying types of play, students are given the platform to develop their 21st century competencies in Critical and Inventive Thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Information skills.  Our lower primary students pick up life skills such as tying their shoelaces and making breakfast, and  learn essential 21st Century skills such as programming and coding with Ozobot and Scratch, as well as build and create with Lego and Strawbees.

Every Friday morning is “Tinker Time” for our lower primary students as they embark on their maker-centred challenges. They begin by tinkering with basic items and gradually move on to dominoes, Lego sets and even coding using Ozobots.  Students are given the freedom to tinker and think of various ways to work on their projects in collaboration with their group members. These activities not only help our students to develop their critical and inventive thinking skills, but also polish their communication and collaboration skills by learning how to be effective team players.

Designed to give the Primary 1 and 2 students a head-start in acquiring these competencies and laying the foundation for them to navigate the changing nature and demands of work, students participate in 4 different modules during the course of each year.
