##### **Introduction**

  

Scouts sessions take the form of an opening ceremony, activities for progress badges, as well as participating in games and songs. Our Senior Scouts (or Sixers) take turns to conduct the opening ceremony while the others take turns to lead games and songs. Through the activities, the Scouts develop a sense of pride and have opportunities to engage with their peers.     

  

Scouts are able to earn badges and awards upon completion of an accomplishment or the learning of a new skill. Sometimes the reward is a pin, patch or trophy. Awards patches are prominently displayed on the Scout uniform, which they wear with pride. Scouts is a great place for boys and girls to learn essential life and leadership skills, which has both a positive impact on their social and educational development.

  

Scouts have three progress levels to achieve from Primary 3 to Primary 6  

  

1.  Bronze Arrow Badge
2.  Silver Arrow Badge
3.  Gold Arrow Badge

  

Going on outdoor exploration, learning about nature, new games, sports and camping, are some of the highlights of being a  Scout.
