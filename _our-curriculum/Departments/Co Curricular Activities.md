<h4><strong>PURPOSE OF CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their
interests and talents. Well-organised and implemented, they can fuel in
the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, be it a sport
or a musical pursuit. This helps the individual to lead a balanced life
in adulthood.</p>
<p>Each CCA has its specific objectives. For instance, Physical Sports (PS)
develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in pupils. The Visual and
Performing Arts (VPA) instil in students a sense of graciousness and an
appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society.
Uniformed Group (UG) activities aim to make good citizens of students by
inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit
of service to others. Clubs and Societies (CS) allow students to explore
and extend their interests in wide ranging and specialised areas which
may be knowledge-based or skills-based. Students are honed in information,
communication and technical skills as they strive to grow their mastery
of the specialised areas.</p>
<p>Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values
and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups.
CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social
and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies.</p>
<p>All CCA emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for friendships
and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Through
CCA, students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.</p>
<p>The school enables all students to have active and meaningful CCA participation
by providing a balanced, inclusive and diverse CCA programme which caters
to a broad spectrum of interests and talents.</p>
