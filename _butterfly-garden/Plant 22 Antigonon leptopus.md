**Plant Morphology :** 

**Growth Form**: Herbaceous slender-stemmed vine, climbs with tendrils arising from ends of inflorescence. Heat and drought-tolerant when established. Fast-growing and quickly covers walls, trellis and arbors with lush foliage. In Singapore, plant may have a tendency to produce flowers only towards top of growth.

**Foliage**:Leaves soft, narrowly heart-shaped, light green, prominently-veined with wavy margins. Leaves are alternately arranged along the stems, simple and borne on petioles (stalks) that are 1 - 5 cm long.

**Stems**: Stems are slender, climbing onto other vegetation via tendrils that are borne on leaf axils.

**Flowers**: Flowers bright pink, fragrant, produced as cascading racemes, attractive to bees and butterflies. Each flower has 5 petals with entire margin with acute tips, 8 stamens and 3 styles and stigmas. The flowers will turn dull pink and eventually brown as they age.

**Fruits**: Brown achene, cone-shaped or three-angled, shiny in appearance. The fruits are usually hidden within the enlarged persistent petals.

  

**Habitat** :  
Found in thickets, rainforest margins, coastal areas, roadsides, disturbed sites and gardens.

  

**Cultivation** :  
Can easily grow on well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates drought when established but appreciates moisture during growing season.
