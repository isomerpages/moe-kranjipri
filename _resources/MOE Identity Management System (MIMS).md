<h4><strong>Managing MIMS Account</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Primary 2 &amp; 3 </strong>- Since these students are still young,
we have done a one-time set up of answers to challenge questions (can be
found in their handbooks).</p>
<p><strong>Primary 4 to 6</strong> - They will need to reset or change their
answers &amp; challenge questions. We believe Upper Primary students are
capable enough to take responsibility and ownership of their MIMS account.</p>
