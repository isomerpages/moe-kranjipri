The school philosophy is ‘**Every Kranjian Matters and Deserves the Best**’ where ‘*We value every student, Every student wants to succeed  and  All can learn’.*

Because we endeavour to deliver the best to our Kranjians, in KPS, no effort is spared to ensure that our curriculum is **forward looking** so that our students can be **future ready** by the time they graduate. 

What is the school’s response to nurturing future ready students?  Our school’s vision of Joyful Learners, Gracious Citizens and Champions in Life is the answer.

Our students are **Joyful Learners** who are critical and inventive thinkers, and highly motivated in their pursuits. 

Compassion and the will to serve is at the Heart of a ‘**Gracious Citizen**’. In KPS, we place a strong emphasis on values and provide opportunities for our young Kranjians to contribute to the community. In fact, our students are involved in Values-in-Action projects which have been an integral part of student life since 1997.

We believe that being a Champion is not about being the best in the field. To be ‘**Champions in Life**’, true champions demonstrate resilience and adaptability in the pursuit of their goals, take **ownership of their learning**, **communicate and collaborate effectively** with others, **lead others and serve the community**. Oftentimes, it is not just in the outcomes, but more importantly, what our Kranjians learn during the process. Hence, in KPS, we pride ourselves to be a school that nurtures Champions.

There is a **strong culture of care** in Kranji Primary School. Our staff collegiality is high and colleagues look out for and support one another. This collegial culture among colleagues is in turn translated into the deep care and support for every Kranjian who passes through our gates.
