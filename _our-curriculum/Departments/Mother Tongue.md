The key features of the Mother Tongue curriculum includes focusing on students' spoken and written interaction skills, having authentic activities to better engage students and develop their communication skills and exposing students to their culture and values through the learning of their Mother Tongue Language. 

  

##### **Department Pedagogy**

**1\. 5-Finger Strategy**

The 5-Finger strategy was designed to help students adapt to the new format in 2017 PSLE E-Oral. Using 5 fingers as visual stimulus, this strategy encompasses the 5 important steps when preparing for the oral exam.

 1)    Read the passage.
 
 2)    Watch the video, listen to the narration and identify the theme and major events.
 
 3)    Choose one of the events and watch the relevant part carefully.
 
 4)    Think about possible experiences related to the theme.
 
 5)    Link to school and community experiences, express personal opinions, feelings, thoughts and ideas.

This structured model serves as a useful guide for pupils to use the silent preparation time wisely by brainstorming on the possible topic and questions that will be asked by the Oral Examiner. To facilitate teaching and learning, teachers have developed customised notes to guide students in their learning.

**2.** **BaiK S²anGaT**

Reading comprehension is the ability to recognise words, sentences and paragraphs and make sense of the overall meaning. The _BaiK S²anGaT_ concept in the teaching of Malay Langauge reading comprehension was designed to help students to understand reading comprehension passages and answer the questions.

This concept encompasses the following strategies:

* read passage / **Ba**ca petikan (_Ba_),

*  iCLUES / **iK**LU (_iK_),

* read questions & highlight key words / baca **S**oal**an** dan **S**erlah kata kunci (_S²an)_,

* underline answers / **Ga**ris jawapan (_Ga_), and

* write question numbers / **T**ulis nombor soalan (_T_).

  

These strategies focus on students' ability to understand comprehension passages and answer the questions in the form of literal and inferential comprehension before moving to more challenging levels.

**3.** **The Story Mountain Strategy**

The story mountain strategy is a pedagogical tool adopted by the Kranji Primary Tamil department. This tool helps children to understand, visualize and remember the 6 aspects that should be addressed in their compositions. The six core aspects of writing a story are:

     1)    Introduction / Beginning

     2)    Setting

     3)    Action

     4)    Climax

     5)    Conflicts

     6)    Resolution

This strategy aids pupils to plan their composition more effectively before writing the actual composition. It also acts as a check list for pupils to self-assess their own work and identify if all the important aspects of a composition in included in their work. 

##### **Mother Tongue Enrichment Programme**

  
**K-Studio**  

K-Studio is our customised broadcasting programme that aims to hone our students’ language skills and instill the joy of learning through authentic and interactive learning experiences. As “Little Reporters”, students learn to gather and organise information for news presentations, speak fluently and articulate their ideas clearly to the audience. Through this process, they build confidence in self-expression. Besides sharpening their oracy skills, students also have the opportunity to collaborate and work as a team to discover the joy of learning and sharing of knowledge.
