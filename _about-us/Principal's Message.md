<p>It is my honour to serve as the sixth Principal of&nbsp;Kranji Primary
School (KPS). I am grateful for the strong foundations laid by my predecessors
and our dedicated staff and am committed to building on their good work
as we continue to grow a school that our students and staff are proud to
call our second home.</p>
<p>Our philosophy, <strong><em>Every Kranjian Matters and Deserves the Best</em></strong>,
resonates with me. It reflects our commitment to ensuring that each student
and staff member is seen, heard, valued, loved and accepted for who they
are. This philosophy drives everything we do, making the growth and well-being
of our students and staff central to the work we do each day. Student and
staff voice and agency matter deeply to us, as we believe that empowered
individuals are more motivated, engaged and committed to learning, growth
and innovation.</p>
<p>This philosophy anchors our vision of nurturing <strong><em>Joyful Learners, Gracious Citizens and Champions in Life</em></strong>,
our&nbsp;mission of <strong><em>Nurturing Minds, Engaging Hearts, Building Character</em></strong> and
our&nbsp;ReCIPe values (<strong><u>Re</u></strong>silience, <strong><u>Re</u></strong>sponsibility, <strong><u>C</u></strong>ompassion, <strong><u>I</u></strong>ntegrity,
Res<strong><u>Pe</u></strong>ct) that shape who we are as a school community.
We see learning as an&nbsp;active, social endeavour—one that is meaningful,
engaging and joyful—while nurturing strong values and developing the&nbsp;21st
century competencies&nbsp;our students need for life and lifelong learning.</p>
<p><strong><u>Nurturing Future-Ready Learners</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Kranji Primary School is committed to provide a forward-looking learning
experience in the school so that all our students can be future-ready at
the end of their six years with us. The KPS Total Curriculum Framework
provides a coherent overview of the school's collective efforts to nurture
future-ready learners. At the heart of the Framework is the vision of the
school to nurture Joyful Learners, Gracious Citizens and Champions in Life.
In order to deliver our vision, the four core attributes of Values, Skills,
Knowledge and Attitudes that every Kranjian needs to have are defined.

</p>
<p>Central to the Kranji Experience are our key programmes, including the&nbsp;<strong>1:1 Learning Experience</strong>&nbsp;that
provides all our P4 to P6 students with an iPad for learning, our&nbsp;<strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong> that
focuses on&nbsp;Nurturing Joyful Learners through Critical and Inventive
Thinking, as well as our <strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP</strong>)
that focuses on&nbsp;Developing Champions in Life through Sports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The school is focused on creating a learning environment which is
student-centric and focuses on student ownership and agency. To enable
this, the school has introduced the <strong>CHAMPS Leadership Programme</strong>,
which is targeted at building in students self-leadership which is critical
for nurturing future-ready learners. Embedded into the programme are key
lessons on Executive Functioning skills, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
and Growth Mindset messages. My Passion Project (MP<sup>2</sup>) is a unique
platform for our Kranjians to apply their leadership skills onto an area
of passion. Through MP<sup>2</sup>, the school provides opportunities for
student voice and ownership and encourages our students to explore their
interest.</p>
<p>The school leverages on multiple community and industry partners to bring
authentic learning experiences to our students. The school has formed a
partnership with an industry partner, EM Services, to bring about authentic
learning experiences for our students during Project Work. Students will
go on learning journeys, facilitated by EM Services, to get an authentic
experience of how science concepts are applied in the real world. The school
has also tapped on expertise from the National Institute of Education,
as well as the Academy of Singapore Teachers to co-design lesson packages
with our teachers in the areas of educational technology and assessment.
To develop global awareness and cross-cultural skills in our Kranjians,
we have tied up with schools in Malaysia, China and Vietnam to bring the
world to Kranji, and to bring our Kranjians to the world through overseas
trips.</p>
<p>All of the above, in our belief that Every Kranjian Matters and Deserves
the Best, and our commitment to provide the best all-rounded education
to your child that is in tune with the times.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Culture of Care</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To support the above, Kranji Primary has a strong culture of care.&nbsp;
We value every child who comes to us, regardless of ability and background,
and believe that every student wants to succeed, and that all can learn.&nbsp;
We have dedicated and experienced teachers and para-educators here in Kranji
Primary who provide holistic care to our students beyond the academic.
Each form class is supported by two form teachers. We have dedicated Year
Heads who look after the Lower, Middle and Upper Primary levels respectively,
and specialists who include a Senior School Counsellor and Special Educational
Needs Officer. Our teachers work very closely with parents and specialists
to provide the best care to each of our Kranjians, to support them in their
holistic growth.</p>
<p><strong><u>Achievements</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2020, we have seen a string of achievements in the student and staff
domains.&nbsp; My colleagues achieved various national-level awards like
Outstanding&nbsp;Youth in Education Award, LEAP Award,&nbsp;Fellow of Academy
of Singapore Teachers Award,&nbsp;National Day Award Commendation Medals
and Long Service Medals, and MOE Service Excellence Awards.&nbsp; &nbsp;Concurrently,
they are leaders in the fraternity with sharings at various national seminars
and conferences in the areas of Math, Project Work, Malay Language and
Chinese Language.&nbsp; This is testament to the quality educators that
we have in our midst at Kranji Primary School.&nbsp; On the student front,
we have achievements across multiple fronts including Math Olympiads, academic
competitions,&nbsp;National School Games Basketball Championships,&nbsp;Singapore
Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation (International Dance &amp; Visual
Arts).&nbsp; Follow this <a href="https://kranjipri.moe.edu.sg/life-at-kranji/achievements/student-and-school-achievement/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a> for
