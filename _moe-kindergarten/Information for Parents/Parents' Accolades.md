“Thank you very much for the heartwarming postcard! We truly appreciate this extra mile for the MOE Kindi students. Abdul Raqeeb has adapted quite well to primary school life. He just gets a bit cranky when waking up in the morning as he wakes up at about 5.30 a.m.😅 He has made friends at school and is a very cheerful boy in school. When asked what his favourite period in school was, he said that recess and snack time are his favourites! 😂 He is a group leader in his group and loves to lead and collect the books when asked to. He looks forward to school everyday and his teachers have given him some points via Classdojo. Those points truly motivate him to do even better every day. He is also responsible when it comes to homework, spelling or to bring certain books to school on a particular day. So far, he updates me without me asking him about homework.

We truly appreciate all the MOE Kindi teachers who have worked very hard in preparing our K2 students last year for their primary school life. You all have laid a strong foundation for these students”.
