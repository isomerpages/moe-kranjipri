**Growth Form**: Barrel-shaped cactus that reaches up to 0.9 m wide after a few decades, but occasionally grows up to 1.8 m wide.

**Stems**:Light green stem is initially ball shaped, but later elongates and becomes barrel-shaped at maturity. When grown in full sun, the stem becomes densely covered in golden-coloured spines.

**Flowers**: Yellow flowers (4 cm wide) form a ring at the crown, being partly submerged in a mass of wool-like hairs. Plants begin to flower after becoming at least 0.35 m wide.

**Fruits**: Pods produce numerous, tiny black seeds (1 mm wide).

  

**Habitat** :  
This species is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over collection. However, it is commonly grown in the nursery trade.

**Cultivation** :  
It will grow well indoors on a bright windowsill, but it must be grown in full sun to flower and develop golden-coloured spines.

**Ethnobotanical Uses** :  
Some desert travellers use this species as a compass.
