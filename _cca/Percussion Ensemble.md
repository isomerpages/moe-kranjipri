##### **Introduction**
  

The Percussion Ensemble aims to enhance studentsâ€™ musical learning experience by introducing them to various percussion instruments, both tuned and untuned. Students will play basic percussive rhythms and create music in an ensemble.&nbsp; Through regular practices, students will have the opportunity to improve their musical skills while benefitting from performing in a ensemble.&nbsp; To provide the Percussion Ensemble students with exposure and showcase their talents, students perform at School Assembly, Year-End Prize Giving Ceremony and participate in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation.
