The older climbing stems are quite thick when mature, and they usually turn brown in colour and become somewhat rounded in shape. The fruit is a capsule with a rounded (spherical) base (about 18 mm long and 13 mm across) and a long tapered beak (2-5 cm long and about 7 mm wide). These fruits are only produced in the warmer climates. The large, flattened (compressed), seeds (up to 10 mm across) are smooth on one side and warty on the other side. Seeds (5-10mm wide) contained in seedpods.
