**Growth Form**: Leguminous, erect, woody shrub or small tree with graceful tiers of horizontal branches. Can be pruned and grown as bushy shrub.

**Foliage**: Leaves compound, opposite, leaflets shaped like kidneys or lungs, light to medium green, with 3 leaflets (2 paired terminal ones, 1 lone and smaller) per petiole. Young leaves orangey, maturing to green. Leaflets and petiole somewhat velvety due to fine surface hairs. Leaves droop and fold up at night.

**Flowers**: Globular Mimosa-like powderpuff inflorescence, 2.5 to 6 cm across, with numerous red or pinkish-red filamentous stamens, lasting 2-3 days before wilting. Unopened flowers buds resemble a bunch of red berries. Free-flowering, providing nectar for hummingbirds, bees, and butterflies like Parthenos sylvia (Malaysian Blue Clipper). Fruits: Flattened dehiscent seedpods. ripening from green to brown, with thickened margin, before splitting open explosively from tip to base, twisting back in a double curve to eject seeds several meters away.

  

**Cultivation**&nbsp;:  
Provide well-watered, well-drained soils. Takes full sun to partial shade. Plant assumes sprawling and lower-growing form under full sun, but is more upright with more open crown under shade. Somewhat slow-growing, but withstands transplanting. If grown as bonsai, wire up younger branches to train them into desired shapes; plant may be temporarily potted in larger containers to encourage thickening of trunk and branches. Propagate by seeds (easier) or stem cuttings. Occasionally affected by white flies and scale insects.

**Ethnobotanical Uses**&nbsp;:  
Medicinal (Flowers are crushed and mixed with water to treat inflammation of the eye and ulcers of the skin. The leaf extract is prescribed for internal complaints.), dried
