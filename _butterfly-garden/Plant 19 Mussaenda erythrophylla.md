**Plant Morphology**&nbsp;:  
Mussaenda is a genus of flowering plants that comprises of about 194 species. This beautiful cultivar developed by Philippine horticulture is considered to be a selected hybrid of Mussaenda erythrophylla X Mussaenda philippica. It’s a tropical shrub or sub-shrub that can reach 3.05 m in height, though can be trained as a single specimen of 1.5 m on ground or less than 1 m in containers. The flower-like clusters of salmon-pink bracts or sepals can be 30 cm wide or more and last for several weeks in eye-catchy ornamental display. The star-shaped or five-petaled tubular flowers in yellow give a lovely contrast amidst the pink-coloured sepals. Nonetheless, it’s really these showy corymbs of shrimp-coloured enlarged leaf-like sepals that are the attention grabber. These lovely sepals also contrast beautifully against their medium green leaves that silky, hairy and elliptical to ovate in shape.

  

**Cultivation**&nbsp;:  
Mussaenda philippica ‘Dona Luz’ is easy-growing and low maintenance. Prefers full sun, but can tolerate semi-shade. Sepals or bracts colour best with full sun and need it to flower continuously, though they’d prefer filtered mid-day sun in hot seasons. Moderate water requirement. Water regularly in hot climates.

**Ethnobotanical Uses**&nbsp;:  
Mussaenda ‘Dona Luz or Dona Luz Pink Mussaenda as commonly known can be grown as an ornamental plant in parks and public gardens or along roadsides, byways and highways. Used in landscaping, this plant serves well as a decorative specimen with its salmon-pink showy bracts and would fit beautifully in home gardens too! Attractive to butterflies and bees.
