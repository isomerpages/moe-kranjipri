##### **Introduction**

  

The Art Club focuses on letting the students demonstrate their creativity and skills by exploring different genres, mediums and materials. They then translate their ideas and thoughts into actual artworks. Our external instructors lend their expertise to expose students to various art processes as an extension to their weekly art CCA sessions. Some activities that we carry out during Art Club CCA are: 

*   Pottery
*   Acrylic painting
*   Sculpturing
*   Doodling
*   Manga Drawing

  

In every CCA session, students will be guided by instructors/experienced teachers to handle the different art mediums. The creativity of each student is valued and they are given the freedom to express themselves within the given concept, and constructive feedback is given by the instructor/experienced teachers throughout the art-making process.
