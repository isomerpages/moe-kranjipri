**Growth Form**: Cactus with an erect, tree-like growth form.

**Foliage**: Tiny leaves occur on the stem where you would expect to find thorns.

**Stems**: Thornless, light green stems are composed of paddle-shaped subunits (10 cm long) which are linked together in a branched pattern. They are mostly smooth with white raised spots which are known as areoles.

**Flowers**: Yellow flowers (4 cm wide) form a ring at the crown, being partly submerged in a mass of wool-like hairs. Plants begin to flower after becoming at least 0.35 m wide.

  

**Habitat**&nbsp;:  
This species is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over collection. However, it is commonly grown in the nursery trade.

**Cultivation**&nbsp;:  
The stem pads root easily. To propagate, place 1 stem pad in well-drained soil with the cut end halfway submerged and roots will gradually form.

**Ethnobotanical Uses**&nbsp;:  
Edible Plant Parts (Edible Stems) Food (Fruit &amp; Vegetable: The pad-like stems can be eaten raw or cooked and are rich in amino acids and vitamins. Young stems have a citrus-like flavour. They can be added to salads, omelettes, soups and stir fry.)
