<h3><strong>EXCITE</strong></h3>
<p>The EXCITE Learning approach outlines how learning is designed, curated
and enacted in the school.</p>
<p>EXperiential</p>
<p>Anchored by the knowledge of how children learn best, learning is designed
to be <strong>Experiential </strong>so as to bring about authentic and purposeful
learning.&nbsp; This facilitates meaningful interactions between the learning
content, the learner and the teacher.</p>
<p>Character Focused</p>
<p><strong>Character Focused </strong>development has always been a prominent
and valued part of the school experience at KPS. School values are leveraged
upon to help students build character and sow the seeds in developing Kranjians
as leaders.</p>
<p>Inquiry Based</p>
<p>In driving the schoolâ€™s efforts to grow Future Ready Learners, opportunities
are provided for exploration, creativity and cognitive development through <strong>Inquiry Based </strong>learning
to build greater student agency.</p>
<p>Technology Mediated</p>
<p>In supporting our students to navigate the future, <strong>Technology Mediated</strong> learning
drives active and deep learning while providing our students with the opportunity
to learn about the ethical and competent use of technology.</p>
<p>Positive Education Driven</p>
<p>Recognising the importance of creating a positive environment for learning
and growth, the school embraces a <strong>Positive Education</strong> approach
to raise student motivation and engagement.</p>
