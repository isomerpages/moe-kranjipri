There is a strong culture of care in Kranji Primary School. Our staff collegiality is high and colleagues would look out for and support one another. This collegial culture among colleagues is in turn translated into the deep care and support for every Kranjian who passes through our gates. This explains our school philosophy ‘**Every Kranjian Matters and Deserves the Best**’ where ‘We value every student, Every student wants to succeed  and  All can learn’.

Because we endeavour to deliver the best to our Kranjians, in KPS, no effort is spared to ensure that our curriculum is **forward looking** so that our students can be **future ready** by the time they graduate. We would like our students to be **Joyful Learners** by being critical and inventive thinkers.

Compassion and the will to serve is at the Heart of a ‘**Gracious Citizen**’. In KPS, we are proud to **serve the community** where Values in Action has been an integral part of student life since 1997.

We believe that being a Champion is not about being the best in the field. To be ‘**Champions in Life**’, true champions demonstrate **resilience** and **adaptability** in the pursuit of their goals, take **ownership of their learning**, **communicate and collaborate effectively** with others, **lead others and serve the community**. Oftentimes, it is not just in the outcomes, but more importantly, what our Kranjians learn during the process. Hence, in KPS, we pride ourselves to be a school that nurtures Champions.
