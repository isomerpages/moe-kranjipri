##### **1.**&nbsp;**Parent Support Group**

We aim to establish a strong home-school partnership with our parents as we believe that parents play a very important role in their children’s development. Through various activities, we seek parents’ involvement by contributing their time, knowledge and expertise to enhance children’s learning experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;
