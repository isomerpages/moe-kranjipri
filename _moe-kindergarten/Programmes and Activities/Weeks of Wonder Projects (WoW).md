To deepen children’s learning, each term culminates in a Weeks of Wonder (WoW) project in which children work together with their peers and teachers to investigate topics of their interest. Through the WoW projects, children experience the joy of self-motivated learning and find answers to their questions through exploration and discovery.

**Neighbourhood Walk**  

Children learnt about their community and the people in the community. This trip around the Yew Tee neighbourhood allowed them to understand more about their community.

As the children learnt about animals, insects and their life cycles, this trip to Insect and Butterfly Kingdom at Sentosa provided experiential learning for the children as they examined real insects and butterflies.
