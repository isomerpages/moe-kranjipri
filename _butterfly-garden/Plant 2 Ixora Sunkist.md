**Growth Form**: Woody shrub, dwarf selection with compact form, up to 0.9m when grown in ground.

**Foliage**: Leaves are bright waxy green, heart-shaped, twisted-looking, closely-clustered and overlapping due to much shortened internodes.

**Flowers**: Red, 4 petals, growing in clusters. They are scentless but a source of nectar for insects. Freely produced throughout the year.

**Cultivation** :  
Hybrid relatively slower-growing than other types of _Ixora_. Prefers acidic soils (pH 5.1 - 6.0) supplemented with iron. Propagate by softwood and semi-hardwood stem cuttings -- use rooting powder to hasten rooting.

**Ethnobotanical Uses** :  
None
