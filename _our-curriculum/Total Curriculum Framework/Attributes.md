<p><u>Executive Functioning Skills</u>
</p>
<p>For our Lower Primary students, Executive Functioning Skills (EFS) have
been identified as pre-requisite skills necessary in every child in order
for learning and engagement to take place.&nbsp; Executive functioning
skills also equip students with strategies that help them to manage their
personal behaviour as well as interact in an appropriate manner with teachers
and peers. &nbsp;Four EFS clusters have been selected that are deemed most
relevant to our lower primary students – Memory, Organisation, Emotion
and Thinking.&nbsp; These are natural upstream articulations of the 7 Habits
that are deemed to be more accessible for Lower Primary students.&nbsp;
Bite-sized packages for Primary 1 and 2 have been created, with emphasis
on allowing our students to experience EFS through hands-on activities
with their peers and teachers.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attitudes</strong>
</p>
<p>In KPS, we hope to actively cultivate and encourage our students to have
a Growth Mindset. We want our students to relish challenges, embrace their
mistakes as part of their learning process, value the importance of effort,
respond carefully to feedback and take inspiration from others. This is
in line with our school values of Resilience and Responsibility. These
learning objectives are articulated through the 6 key messages below and
are consistently reinforced to our students throughout their six years
in the school.</p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowledge</strong>
</p>
<p>Knowledge of the subjects includes the concepts, facts, theories and skills,
as well as how they are connected to present the disciplinarity of the
subject, as set out in the syllabus for each subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social-emotional competencies enable us to examine and understand our
own thoughts and emotions, develop a sense of responsibility and concern
for others, and act for the good of self, others, and the society. When
we apply these competencies, we live out our values and grow our character.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The competencies related to developing <strong>self-awareness </strong>allow
us to understand our emotions, thoughts, values, personal goals, and mind-sets,
which enable us to construct an understanding of who we are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The competencies related to <strong>social awareness </strong>enable us
to develop cognitive and emotional empathy, understand the perspectives
of people with different backgrounds or cultures, and to become more sensitive
to the social environment and the needs of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The competencies for <strong>self-management </strong>enable us to self-regulate
our emotions, thoughts and behaviours, to achieve personal well-being,
to demonstrate pro-social behaviours, and to choose to be our best selves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The competencies for <strong>relationship management </strong>enable us
to build and maintain positive relationships with others in accordance
to social norms and culture. We also develop empathy through practising
perspective-taking, and understanding the impact and consequences of our
actions on others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsible decision-making </strong>enables us to apply moral
reasoning and sound values-based judgements in the choices we make.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These competencies can be taught, demonstrated, and applied through explicit
instruction, planned authentic learning experiences, as well as teachable
moments. For sustainable lifelong character development, these competencies
must be taught, learnt, and applied within the broader context of values
learning so that students understand the purpose and meaningfulness of
acquiring these competencies.</p>
