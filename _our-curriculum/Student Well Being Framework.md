#### **Student Well-being Framework**
  

Guided by our vision and mission, we are committed to developing Kranjians to be Joyful Learners, Gracious Citizens and Champions in Life. By advocating the 6 elements of psychological well-being and happiness 
(**P**ositive Emotion, **E**ngagement, **R**elationship, 
**M**eaning, **A**chievement and **H**ealth) adapted from Professor Martin Seligman’s Positive Education framework, as well as Stanford University Professor Carol Dweck’s Growth Mindset Theory, we hope to empower our students to build resilience and learn to motivate themselves toward achievement for success.

Values define a student’s character. They shape the beliefs, attitudes and actions of a student. Therefore, it forms the core of our school’s student well-being framework. The yellow hexagon signifies the PERMAH
(**P**ositive Emotion, **E**ngagement, **R**elationship, 
**M**eaning, **A**chievement and **H**ealth) model that promotes Positive Education. These six elements interplay with one another to create a school culture and environment that can help our students succeed and prosper.

The blue ring of the framework represents the 3 climates that are essential to support a positive school environment – namely Climate of Trust, Climate of Respect and Climate of Care. Students thrive best in an environment that is safe and where positive emotions flow to create a climate of care, in an environment of respect for all. We do this through affirming students for their strengths, talents and efforts.

Together, these elements provide a strong foundation for the development of the Desired Outcomes of Education (DOE) in our students – who are Self-directed Learners, Confident Persons, Active Contributors and Concerned Citizens.

##### **Student Well-being Approach**

  
At Kranji Primary School, we use the **K**nowledge-**P**ractice-**S**uccess (**KPS**) approach to enhance student morale and well-being.  
  
1. **Knowledge** \- Learn and Experience  
  

Our student development efforts aim to develop students with skills, knowledge and a positive attitude to confront challenges confidently, embrace setbacks and contribute to the well-being of others and the wider community. In KPS, we hope to actively cultivate and encourage our students to have a Growth Mindset. We want our students to relish challenges, embrace their mistakes as part of their learning process, value the importance of effort, respond carefully to feedback and take inspiration from others. This is in line with our school values of Resilience and Responsibility. These learning objectives are articulated through the 6 key messages below and are consistently reinforced to our students throughout their six years in the school.

  

*   I Can Grow My Brain
*   I Love to Learn
*   I Embrace Challenges
*   I Give My Best
*   I Learn from my Mistakes
*   I Learn from Others

  

To maintain **positive health**, the school has introduced mindfulness to our staff and students. Mindfulness helps students regulate their emotions and thoughts, and refocus their energies on the present. As it becomes a routine and habit, it is hoped that they can practise mindfulness in other aspects of their lives. Talks by our School Counsellor on coping with stress and anxiety, mental wellness and help seeking strategies have equipped the students with the relevant skills to maintain their own well-being. The school has also partnered with the National Healthcare Group to add to our efforts to teach the Growth Mindset and to help our students make better nutrition choices to enhance their total well-being.

  

As part of the school’s effort to nurture **positive relationships**, termly Level Connect and Buddy Level Connect sessions are conducted.  For the latter, all P1 to P3 junior Kranjians are matched to a P4 to P6 senior buddy respectively. They then become a senior buddy to a new P1 Kranjian when they are in P4. Through these platforms, students build bonds within the level, strengthen relationships with peers, buddies and teachers, and benefit from the sense of fraternity and school identity.

  

2. **Practice** \- Develop and Grow

  

The school provides ample platforms and opportunities for students to showcase the skills, good habits and appropriate social behaviours they have developed.

  

Weekly ‘What Went Well’ sessions are conducted for students to share positive moments that they have experienced in the week with their friends and teachers.  Students learn that showing appreciation to someone is a simple act of kindness that strengthens relationships and increases **positive emotions.** This is part of resilience-building, which leads to better stress management and overall well-being.  Each class has a Gratitude Wall to encourage students to write their blessings for one another. The annual Gratitude Day also encourages the students to show their gratitude to the different staff segments in the school.

  

In addition, all students practise compassion towards self, others and the school community through service learning platforms both in and out of the school, such that it becomes a way of life. This creates **positive meaning** in students. It is hoped that what our students experience in school will have a multiplying effect when they can continue the goodness at home and in the community.

  

3. **Success** \- Demonstrate and Glow

  

Students need positive engagement to enhance their motivation and build resilience. Our staff and students write motivational cards to one another. The school’s ‘Caught You Doing Good’ Programme provides extrinsic motivation to encourage students to display positive behaviour. Teachers consciously make it a point to praise effort rather than outcomes. In addition, our ‘Star Student Awardees’ are treated to incentive trips to motivate them to be the contagion agents for positive behaviour.  

  

Through the various programmes and activities, we hope the students will be able to attain **positive achievement**. As part of our pre-assembly programme, teachers highlight students who displayed resilience and beat the odds to succeed in academics, sports and character. Teachers also nominate students who are exemplary in character and present them with the Star Award during level connect. In addition, our annual Prize Giving Day celebrates students’ achievements not only in their academic progress but also the demonstration of our school’s core values and positive learning dispositions. All this culminates in the Joy of Learning Day, an annual event that celebrates the learning process and the multiple student innovations that were created in the course of the year.  On this day, students share their knowledge and experience and showcase their learning to the school population.

  

The school’s Student Well-being Framework and Approach is testament to our School Philosophy of _Every Kranjian Matters and Deserves the Best._
