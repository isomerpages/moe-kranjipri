<h4>Environment</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caring and Enabling Environment</p>
<p>As humans, we have basic psychological needs to connect with others, feel
emotionally and physically safe, have a sense of belonging, exercise autonomy,
and experience competence. These fundamental needs shape our motivation
and have important implications for learning and development. Schools are
places where these needs can be met by building a caring community through
positive relationships among staff and students where there is mutual respect,
care, and support for one another. When these needs are met, students feel
more connected to their school and are motivated to own their learning
and school community together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A caring and enabling school environment, is one that is characterised
by caring and responsible leadership, a pervasive growth mindset, emotional
and physical safety, and a focus on learning and development of students,
teachers and all other members of the school community. In such a rich
learning environment, our students can cultivate dispositions of character
and citizenship, and social-emotional well-being, as well as feel empowered
to become their best selves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Positive interpersonal relationships between teachers and students and
students and students, contribute significantly to the studentsâ€™ learning
process. In positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR), students perceive
they are respected, supported and valued by their teachers. When students
experience positive TSR, they are more engaged in school and able to sustain
their learning motivation. When teachers build positive relationships with
their students, our students feel a sense of security which allows them
to engage more actively in interactions within the school environment,
shaping their character, and social-emotional well-being and development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supportive peer relationships form a critical part of the network of positive
relationships in school. Peers are a significant source of support for
most students as they are more likely to turn to their friends rather than
adults for help. With Peer Support and Relationships (PSR), students participate
in fostering strong bonds of friendships and a sense of belonging to the
school community (peer bonding), provide practical help and social-emotional
support to one another (peer helping) and promote positive mindsets, prosocial
behaviours and well-being (peer influencing). Taken together, these efforts
contribute to the building of a caring and supportive peer culture, by
students for students.</p>
