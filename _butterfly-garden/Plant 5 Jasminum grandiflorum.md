**Plant Morphology :**&nbsp;

**Growth Form**:&nbsp; An evergreen scandent shrub in the tropics with long, rather stiff branches.

**Foliage**: Opposite leaves are elliptic to ovate with dentate leaf margin (4 - 11 cm long).

**Flowers**: Flowers are 5 cm in diameter, white, very fragrant and borne in clusters. Flower buds are pinkish in colour and floral initiation is promoted by high day and low night temperatures. Flowers open early in the morning and oil content decreases by early morning.

**Fruits**: Seldom formed, fruits are 2-lobed berries that turn black when ripe.

  

**Cultivation**&nbsp;:  
Plant prefers to grow in direct sun with adequate soil moisture and should be planted in moist, well-draining, fertile soil that is rich in organic matter. Does not tolerate waterlogging. Growth and flowering are hindered by shade, prolonged drought, low daytime temperatures and cool wet conditions. Plants can get straggly with time and need to be prune periodically. Plants can get attacked by spider mites and are susceptible to root and stem rots due to overly wet conditions

**Ethnobotanical Uses**&nbsp;:  
Food (Herb &amp; Spice: In China and Indonesia, jasmine flowers are popular to flavour tea. Jasmine absolute (essential oil) and concrete (waxy solid containing essential oil) are used as additives in food and tobacco. Medicinal (Jasmine oil or essence functions as a muscle relaxant. The infusion of flowers treats coughs and can be applied externally for skin diseases.) Cultural / Religious (Fragrant flowers have been used for personal adornment, in religious ceremonies, strewn at feasts and added to baths. Essential oil extracted from the flowers is used in the perfumery industry.
