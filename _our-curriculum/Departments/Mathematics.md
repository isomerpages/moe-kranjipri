##### **Math Curriculum Framework**

  
The central focus of the Mathematics Framework is mathematical problem solving, that is, using Mathematics to solve problems. The framework stresses conceptual understanding, skills proficiency and mathematical processes, and gives due emphasis to attitudes and metacognition. These five components are inter-related.

##### **Department Pedagogy**

  

We believe every Kranjian can be a joyful and confident problem solver with strong numeracy skills. Our Math lessons aim to:

  

1) Help Kranjians acquire skills and concepts relevant to real-world context, 

2) Develop thinking, reasoning and communication skills and 

3) Build confidence and foster interest 

  

**Activity-Based Learning**

We plan learning experiences and opportunities for Kranjians to learn skills and concepts by doing. They are actively involved in constructing knowledge through hands on experiences

Teaching resources are used to help Kranjians interact as well as to construct meaning and understanding.

**Teacher-directed Inquiry**

We lead Kranjians to explore, investigate and find answers on their own. This is achieved by providing opportunities for them to communicate ideas, questions and comments using mathematical language.

##### **Math Level Programmes**

  

At KPS, we focus on building strong numeracy and problem-solving skills in our students through engaging them in experiential learning that is in line with MOE’s ‘Teach Less Learn More’ initiative.  Our Fun-In-Learning programme provides varied platforms for them to explore and discover mathematical ideas and concepts in fun and meaningful ways.

Through games, skills such as spatial-visualization, reasoning and critical thinking are enhanced.

##### **Math Enrichment Programme**

Learning of mathematics should be fun, relevant and meaningful to students.  We immerse students in a learning environment that arouses creativity and stimulates thinking. Our Math Champion Chef programme seeks to ignite the joy of learning through authentic learning experiences in baking. As students apply mathematics in real-life activities, their mathematical concepts and skills are reinforced, reasoning and communication skills are strengthened and they will see the relevance of mathematics in real life that makes learning of mathematics meaningful.

##### **Talent Development Programme**

High-ability learners in mathematics are given the opportunity to realise their potential through our Talent Development Programme, which aims to develop students’ critical and creative thinking, and cultivate students’ confidence and perseverance.  Our programme focuses on providing enrichment and competition opportunities, by adopting a differentiated approach at the upper primary levels.

  

To cater to the needs of students who have performed well in mathematics, we make provision for them to use different Teaching & Learning materials that include advanced content with a problem-solving focus. We engage the students in activities that promote high-level thinking as well as problem solving appropriate at their level.

  

**Olympiad Training & Competitions**

Through the Olympiad training, students expand their knowledge of mathematical concepts to develop higher-order problem solving and critical thinking skills. We also prepare students for various Olympiad competitions to help them gain a deeper insight to challenging Mathematics.  

**Excellence 2000 (E2K)**

The Excellence 2000 (E2K) Math Talent Development Programme is offered to Primary 4 and 5 high-ability learners. It aims to develop students’ mathematical reasoning skills and to deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through puzzles, games and Mathematical explorations.  The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess, and gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention thinking and effective communication skills.  The programme is conducted in-house by our Math teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy by MOE Gifted Education Branch (GEB).

##### **Support Programme**

  

We have a structured approach to support students’ development of basic numeracy skills.  Emphasis is placed on motivating students and building their love for and confidence in mathematics.

*           Learning Support Math (LSM) @ Lower Primary
*         After-School Remediation for P2 to P6
*         Small-class teaching to support the students’ varied learning needs 

##### **Tips for parents**

Help to develop number sense in the following ways:

 Make Math fun at home by playing games involving math concepts. Games can be used to promote critical thinking and reasoning skills.

  Look for Math around us and talk about how it relates/connects to real-life situations

  Encourage explanation of his/her thinking or reasoning when solving math problems

  Encourage right attitude to respond positively to errors

   Always check his/her work before submission

   Identify own errors

   Reflect what has gone wrong

  Correct the errors 

 Encourage speed and accuracy in recalling basic math facts to strengthen basic calculation skills:

   Commit to memory - Multiplication table

   Conversions of units/fractions/decimals/percentage

**In preparation of Math examinations:**

 Do not over-do home-based practice papers

 Enable your child to do full practice papers in one sitting (within the stipulated time)

Encourage good time management
