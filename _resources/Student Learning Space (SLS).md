<p>At Kranji Primary School, we believe in helping every child find joy in
learning and equip our students with the skill to leverage on technology
to become future-ready champions in life.</p>
<p>As part of Ministry of Education’s (MOE) commitment to nurture future-ready
learners, an online learning platform known as the Singapore Student Learning
Space (SLS) has been developed and rolled out in 2018 by MOE. The SLS is
an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources for all
students to&nbsp;learn anytime, anywhere, collaboratively and at their
own pace. With the SLS, students can take&nbsp;greater ownership of their
learning and pick up skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning.&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Teachers will also use the SLS to complement classroom teaching and learning
through designing meaningful lessons for students to explore and work collaboratively
as well as facilitate students to learn at their own pace.&nbsp; &nbsp;The
Singapore SLS is collectively shaped by teachers and students. Taking into
consideration their ideas and feedback on the resources and tools, the
system is developed iteratively to stay dynamic and responsive.</p>
