##### **Introduction**
  

Development of students is differentiated based on their readiness. After a quick warm up, they are guided through routines like dribbling, lay-ups and ball control. Students with more advanced basketball skills will practise attacking and defensive drills. They will also take part in basketball games to put into practice what they have learnt. School team players work with the coaches on more specific drills such as attack or defence moves and set plays. 

  

As part of the development, school team players will be able to participate in the National School Games and other inter-school friendly tournaments.

  

Kranji Basketball has also supported many players to gain entry into secondary schools through Direct School Admission (DSA).  The following are some of the schools that our alumni players have attained entry to through DSA:  

  

*   Bukit Panjang Government High
*   Catholic High School

*   Raffles Institution
*   Singapore Chinese Girls' School
*   Singapore Sports School
*   Swiss Cottage Secondary School
*   Unity Secondary

It's not the height, but the passion and skills that matter

Look at the camera over there! Maybe I will have a chance to get the ball then
