In view of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) situation, HBL aims to ensure that learning continues for students during school closure. Students will be completing their online assignments for the respective subjects through the **SLS Learning portal**: [Student Learning Space (SLS)](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg) (with Google Chrome or Apple Safari).
