<p>The KPS Total Curriculum Framework provides a coherent overview of the
school’s collective efforts to nurture future-ready learners.&nbsp; At
the heart of the Framework is the vision of the school to nurture Joyful
Learners, Gracious Citizens and Champions in Life.&nbsp; This is further
elaborated through our Student Outcomes, which takes guidance from MOE’s
Framework for 21st Century Competencies (21CC) and Student Outcomes (

order to deliver these outcomes, the four core attributes of Values, Skills,
Knowledge and Attitudes are defined, as well as the accompanying key initiatives
to develop these attributes.</p>
<p>The EXCITE Learning Approach outlines how learning is designed, curated
and enacted in the school daily.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is supported by an environment
that is caring and enabling, promotes student ownership &amp; agency, and
values student centricity.</p>
