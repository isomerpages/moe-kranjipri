#### **MOE Kindergarten @ Kranji**&nbsp;

Our curriculum and programmes are based on the Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework that guides the development of kindergarten programmes in Singapore.&nbsp;

At MOE Kindergarten (MK), we believe preschool children are curious, active and competent learners. They’re keen to make sense of the world around them, and they learn best through active learning.&nbsp;  

We strive to make learning authentic and relevant for your child through activities with a distinctive Singapore flavour. This helps nurture your child’s:  

*   Confidence and social skills.
*   Literacy and numeracy skills.&nbsp;
*   Bilingualism in English and their Mother Tongue Language (i.e. Chinese, Malay and Tamil languages).&nbsp;

Classrooms typically have up to 20 children, divided into smaller groups for specific activities.&nbsp;

In place of giving workbooks or worksheets as homework, we encourage family-based learning activities that you and your child can engage in together. This will help you bond with your child and share the joy of their growth and learning.&nbsp;
