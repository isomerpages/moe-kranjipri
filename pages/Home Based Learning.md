In view of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) situation, HBL aims to ensure that learning continues for students during school closure. Students will be completing their online assignments for the respective subjects through the **SLS Learning portal**: [**https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login**](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login)  (with Google Chrome or Apple Safari).   

  

The school has prepared a **HBL  plan** for our students, indicating the title of the assignments to be completed for the day. The HBL plan for each level is as follows:

  

|   Level   | HBL Weekly Plan (Mon-Thurs) |
|:---------:|:---------------------------:|
| Primary 1 |    HBL Plan 11Oct- 12Oct    |
| Primary 2 |    HBL Plan 11Oct - 12Oct   |
| Primary 3 |             N.A             |
| Primary 4 |             N.A             |
| Primary 5 |             N.A             |
| Primary 6 |              N.A            |

  

  

We look forward to your continued support towards a fruitful learning experience for our children and seek your patience and understanding in monitoring your child in his/her learning at home.
