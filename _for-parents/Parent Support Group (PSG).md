### **Benefits of Joining PSG:**

PSG is a great opportunity for us to be closer to our children, understand them better and help them in their education journey. 

  

Our children benefit when we are more active in the school environment.  They tend to:

*   show more positive attitudes  
    
*   have better school attendance and complete homework more consistently
*   be able to bridge the cultural gap between school and home
*   be less anti-social and less prone to behavioural issues

### **PSG Focus Group**

We are a group of parents who play a key role in inspiring our fellow PSG members and coordinating their time and effort to contribute to the school’s programmes.
