<h3><strong>Attributes</strong></h3>
<p>In order to achieve our Student Outcomes, the school believes that equal
emphasis needs to be given to a broad spectrum of attributes. The CHAMPS
Leadership Programme integrates the various efforts of the school to build
skills and competencies in our students to first become leaders of self,
before they proceed to lead others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 4 key components in the CHAMPS Leadership Programme:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong anchor on the school values
of <strong><u>Re</u></strong>sponsibility, <strong><u>Re</u></strong>silience, <strong><u>C</u></strong>ompassion, <strong><u>I</u></strong>ntegrity
and Res<strong><u>PE</u></strong>ct provide our Kranjians with the recipe
for success.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The socio-emotional competencies of self
awareness, self management, social awareness, relationship management and
responsible decision making are taught to the students as part of the CCE(FTGP)
curriculum.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growth Mindset is adopted to instil in
students the mindset that it is okay to make mistakes and the importance
of reflecting and growing.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through Executive Functioning, the school
aims to equip in students important skills they need to achieve their goals.
The school has also introduced the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
(Leader in Me) concepts to the students as an extension of Executive Functioning
Skills. The aim is to build self-leadership in students so that they take
ownership of themselves and their learning.</p>
<p>The above are conducted and taught to all KPS students and they are designed
to build the values, knowledge, skills and attitudes required of a future-ready
learner.</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skills</strong>
</p>
<p>Through Executive Functioning Skills, the school aims to equip in students
important skills they need to achieve their goals. The school has also
introduced the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (Leader in Me) concepts
to the students. The aim is to build self-leadership in students so that
they take ownership of their learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Executive Functioning Skills</u>
</p>
<p>For our Lower Primary students, Executive Functioning Skills (EFS) have
been identified as pre-requisite skills necessary in every child in order
for learning and engagement to take place.&nbsp;Executive functioning skills
also equip students with strategies that help them to manage their personal
behaviour as well as interact in an appropriate manner with teachers and
peers. Four EFS clusters have been selected that are deemed most relevant
to our lower primary students – Memory, Organisation, Emotion and Thinking.
These are natural upstream articulations of the 7 Habits that are deemed
to be more accessible for Lower Primary students.&nbsp;Bite-sized packages
for Primary 1 and 2 have been created, with emphasis on allowing our students
to experience EFS through hands-on activities with their peers and teachers.</p>

<p><u>7 Habits for Highly Effective People</u>
</p>
<p>The school adopts the 7 Habits for Highly Effective People (<a href="https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits</a>)
for the explicit teaching of leadership skills to our students.&nbsp; The
key essence of the 7 Habits has been distilled into bite-sized learning
packages tailored to lower/middle/upper primary levels, and taught by Form
Teachers as part of the CHAMPS Leadership Programme .&nbsp;The 7 Habits
provide students with applicable tools that they could practise in their
daily lives, and serve to motivate them to make positive steps to improve
in order to be more effective as a learner.&nbsp;This has also been extended
to cater to student leaders through extended leadership training in 7 Habits,
with a focus on application.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attitudes</strong>
</p>
<p>In KPS, we hope to actively cultivate and encourage our students to have
a Growth Mindset. We want our students to relish challenges, embrace their
mistakes as part of their learning process, value the importance of effort,
respond carefully to feedback and take inspiration from others. This is
in line with our school values of Resilience and Responsibility. These
learning objectives are articulated through the 6 key messages below and
are consistently reinforced to our students throughout their six years
in the school.</p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowledge</strong>
</p>
<p>Knowledge of the subjects includes the concepts, facts, theories and skills,
as well as how they are connected to present the disciplinarity of the
subject, as set out in the syllabus for each subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social-emotional competencies enable us to examine and understand our
own thoughts and emotions, develop a sense of responsibility and concern
for others, and act for the good of self, others, and the society. When
we apply these competencies, we live out our values and grow our character.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The competencies related to developing <strong>self-awareness </strong>allow
us to understand our emotions, thoughts, values, personal goals, and mind-sets,
which enable us to construct an understanding of who we are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The competencies related to <strong>social awareness </strong>enable us
to develop cognitive and emotional empathy, understand the perspectives
of people with different backgrounds or cultures, and to become more sensitive
to the social environment and the needs of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The competencies for <strong>self-management </strong>enable us to self-regulate
our emotions, thoughts and behaviours, to achieve personal well-being,
to demonstrate pro-social behaviours, and to choose to be our best selves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The competencies for <strong>relationship management </strong>enable us
to build and maintain positive relationships with others in accordance
to social norms and culture. We also develop empathy through practising
perspective-taking, and understanding the impact and consequences of our
actions on others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsible decision-making </strong>enables us to apply moral
reasoning and sound values-based judgements in the choices we make.</p>
</li>
</ul>
