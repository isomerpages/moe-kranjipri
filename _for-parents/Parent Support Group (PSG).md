#### **Benefits of Joining PSG:**

PSG is a great opportunity for us to be closer to our children, understand them better and help them in their education journey.&nbsp;

  

Our children benefit when we are more active in the school environment.&nbsp; They tend to:

*   show more positive attitudes  
    
*   have&nbsp;better school attendance and complete homework more consistently
*   be able to bridge the cultural gap between school and home
*   be less anti-social and less prone to behavioural issues
