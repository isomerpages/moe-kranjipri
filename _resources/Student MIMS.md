<h4><strong>What is Student MIMS?</strong></h4>
<p>Student MOE Identity Management System (MIMS) is a new system that allow
students to access MOE applications such as Student Learning Space (SLS),
Student iCON,- Media Resource Library (MRL), etc.</p>
<h4><strong>Managing MIMS Account</strong></h4>
<p>This is how students will manager their MIMS account.</p>
<p><strong>Primary 2 &amp; 3 </strong>- Since these students are still young,
we have done a one-time set up of answers to challenge questions (printed
in card form and attached to their student handbook).</p>
<p><strong>Primary 4 to 6</strong> - They will need to reset or change their
answers &amp; challenge questions. We believe Upper Primary students are
capable enough to take responsibility and ownership of their MIMS account.</p>
<p><strong>Please take note the MIMS username follows this format.</strong>
</p>
<p>Example: Muhammad Ali Bin Muhammad Raihan</p>
<p>Username: muhammad_ali_muhammad_raihan@students.edu.sg</p>
