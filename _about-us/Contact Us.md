**In the event that students require urgent dental treatment during the periods the roving team is not stationed in KPS, parents can call the following buddy clinics for an appointment:**

Students with dental emergencies (e.g. severe pain affecting sleep, facial swelling due to dental infection, dental injury) when the dental clinic is not in operation may call for an appointment to be seen at the School Dental Centre in HPB. The contact details are DID: 6435-3782 (Mondays to Fridays, 8 am to 5 pm) or email: HPB\_Dental\_Counter@hpb.gov.sg.
