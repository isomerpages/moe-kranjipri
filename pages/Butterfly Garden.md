Butterflies are some of the most beautiful and interesting creatures on Earth. By setting up a butterfly garden with all of the right kinds of plants and flowers that butterflies love to feed on and lay eggs on, we will certainly have a yard full of butterflies throughout the growing season.

Here are the plants found at the butterfly garden. Most of the plants are host and nectar plants for the butterflies and their young. Others, such as cacti and ornamentals are for enhancing studentsâ€™ learning.
