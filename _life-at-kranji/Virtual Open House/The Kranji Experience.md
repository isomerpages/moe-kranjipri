##### **Junior Tinkering Programme**

The Junior Tinkering Programme (JTP) develops children in their critical and inventive thinking skills as they tinker on their mini projects. Through the JTP, students learn essential 21st Century skills such as programming and coding with Ozobot and Scratch Junior as well as build and create with Logo and Strawbees. Watch this video and spend some quality time with your child by building a dream playground together at home.

##### **English Reading Programme**&nbsp;

Our reading programme focuses on the development and reinforcement of the key language skills (Reading, Oracy, Listening and Writing) through an enjoyment of the language and promotion of extensive reading. Students are exposed to a wide array of activities that are closely aligned to the STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) programme to build a love for the language and master core language skills progressively. To develop a strong language foundation, students read, listen and view texts so that they can write about and discuss topics of relevance and interest to them. In addition, drama is used as a vehicle to complement the reading programme and to inject an element of fun in language learning. Such social engagement will encourage respectful, confident exchanges, as well as a love and enjoyment of the language that will greatly enhance the motivation to learn it.&nbsp;

  

An exciting reader’s theatre performance awaits you! Continue to immerse yourself in the story by following the video to make a chef’s hat and pizza toast with your child.&nbsp;

##### **Character and Citizenship Education**

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) at Kranji Primary School adopts an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional well-being and citizenship dispositions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The curriculum includes National Education (NE) events, experiential lessons in the classroom, Values in Action (VIA) activities, Co-curricular activities (CCAs), outdoor activities, Cyber Wellness and peer-support initiatives. We hope to create opportunities for students to develop leadership competencies, as well as a sense of belonging to their school community and the motivation to make a positive difference to self, each other and the wider community.&nbsp;

##### **Applied Learning Programme**&nbsp;

The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is specially designed to develop critical and&nbsp;inventive Kranjians.&nbsp;The programme runs through a 3-tiered Approach – Experience, Inquire and Hone, anchored by a strong foundation in Science and Math curriculum. Under the ‘Experience’ tier, the K-Maker programme engages students in the process of making. Students are able to&nbsp;design, experiment, build and invent their prototype with upcycling initiatives in the&nbsp;Makerspace room. Upcycling allows students to be creative as they reinvent unwanted materials and transform them into useful products. Let’s do our part to promote upcycling. Watch the video and learn how to make a paper wallet using a recyclable paper bag.&nbsp;

##### **P4 1:1 Learning Experience**  
1:1 refers to one device for every student, where students will access learning through the device, both in and out of the classroom. By equipping students with an individual learning device in school, they are able to access the Internet and apps to complete online activities, document their learning progress and save their work across their subjects with ease.&nbsp;  
  
The main aim of the 1:1 Learning Experience is to enable our students to gain future-ready competencies. By redesigning how teachers teach and how students learn with technology, we strive to create a positive and impactful teaching and learning environment which encourages our students to:&nbsp;

1. take ownership of their learning
2. participate in collaborative learning and
3. extend their learning beyond the classroom
