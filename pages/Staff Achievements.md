Our Year Head Mdm Nur Fazalina was conferred the LEAP Award (飞跃教师奖) 2020, which stands for “Listening Educator for Advancement and Progress Award”, which was launched by the late former President S R Nathan in 2011 and awarded by Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan (SHHK) annually to recognise exceptional teachers who have made a positive impact in nurturing their students from the heart. The naming of the award signifies a leap of faith for a teacher to believe that students have the potential to excel beyond their capabilities.  
  
Here's a special mention of Mdm Nur Fazalina in Minister Lawrence Wong's speech at the LEAP Award on 1 Sep:  
"One example is Mdm Nur Fazalina Binte Hussin from Kranji Primary School.

As the Year Head, she put together a care plan for the students and she went the extra mile to ensure that students lacking the necessary IT equipment could loan a device from school.

Recognising that some of her students' home environments were not conducive for learning, she made it a point to check on them everyday. She also spearheaded the JumpStart@Kranji programme to step up support for students' well-being.

Mdm Fazalina's care extends to more than her students. To her fellow teachers, especially new teachers who just started on their teaching journey, she is like a big sister. Her positive spirit, constant encouragement and guidance has helped to welcome and orientate them to the school."
