This is one of my form teachers, Mr Soh. He has a great sense of humour and being in his class always cheers me up! Sometimes, he shares funny stories with the class to brighten our day, and his stories never fail to cheer us up.

My favourite lesson would be Project Work in Science, because it challenges me to think creatively to solve real-world problems! One of our Project Work tasks was to design a water filtration system to remove the pollutants from the dirty water. I felt like an engineer and it was so much fun!

Every day, I look forward to playing with my friends. Some of my favourite friends are those who play basketball with me. After we eat, we spend the rest of our recess time playing basketball. As we love basketball, we are also in our schoolâ€™s basketball CCA and get to participate in many competitions!

One of my go-to places in school is the ground floor of the Indoor Sports Hall (ISH), where everyone comes to play.

I also love going to my school library to browse and borrow interesting books!

This is the Life Skills Room, where I baked my first cupcake during our Math Champion Chef programme!
