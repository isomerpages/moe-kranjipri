##### **ICT Curriculum Framework**

In Kranji Primary School, we believe in preparing our students to be future-ready champions in life. Therefore, the ICT department aims to create an ICT enriched environment, providing opportunities for our students to be joyful and responsible digital learners through a range of quality learning experiences with technology. 

Our school’s ICT literacy programme is built on MOE’s standards of new media literacy and includes the skills, knowledge, attitudes and values (SKAV) that students should apply and demonstrate when harnessing ICT for learning and interacting. The new ICT baseline standards are: curating digital content; connecting and communicating digitally; and creating digital multimodal products.

##### **Department Pedagogy**

  

With the introduction of the Student Learning Space (SLS), learning with technology in Kranji Primary School is guided by the SLS Pedagogical Scaffold which enables teachers to design technology-enabled learning experiences to enhance students’ learning.  

In designing learning with technology, teachers consider the following student-centric active learning process while planning a technology-enabled lesson:

**Activate Learning**

*   How will students’ focus and interest be oriented towards the learning objectives?

**Promote Thinking and Discussion**

*   How will students think about ideas and concepts?
*   What skills and processes will students perform?
*   How will students build on their current understanding?

**Facilitate Demonstration of Learning**

*   How will students demonstrate their understanding and new learning?

**Monitor and Provide Feedback**

*   How can students’ learning be advanced?

  

**Level Programmes**

  

Our ICT programmes across P1 to P6 aims to equip every student with the fundamental ICT skills and literacy to be a future-ready individual. Through the introduction of computational thinking and the infusion of new media literacies into different disciplines, the programme sets out to achieve the following objectives, where students are able to:

1\. Acquire and apply technical skills to create digital content

2\. Demonstrate 21st CC through self-directed and collaborative learning

3\. Develop computational thinking and problem-solving skills

##### **ICT Facilities**

  

The school has three computer laboratories and three mobile carts equipped with laptops optimised for teaching and learning purposes. Students and teachers also have access to the use of iPads, chromebooks, galaxy tabs for mobile learning to take place. A wireless network is in place to further enhance students' learning and teachers are able to conduct lessons anywhere in our school using these devices.

In collaboration with both the instructional and non-instructional programmes, students have opportunities to enhance their learning experience in an ICT-empowered learning environment, helping them to become innovative, confident and  independent learners.
