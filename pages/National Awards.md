Congratulations to our Year Head, Mdm Nur Fazalina Bte Hussin, for being awarded the Listening Educator for Advanceent and Progress (LEAP)  Award 2020.   
  
Here's a special mention of her efforts by Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister of Education:  
  
"One example is Mdm Nur Fazalina Binte Hussin from Kranji Primary School. As the Year Head, she put together a care plan for the students and she went the extra mile to ensure that students lacking the necessary IT equipment could loan a device from school.  

Recognising that some of her students' home environments were not conducive for learning, she made it a point to check on them everyday. She also spearheaded the JumpStart@Kranji programme to step up support for students' well-being.

Mdm Fazalina's care extends to more than her students. To her fellow teachers, especially new teachers who just started on their teaching journey, she is like a big sister. Her positive spirit, constant encouragement and guidance has helped to welcome and orientate them to the school."
