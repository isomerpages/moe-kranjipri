**Growth Form**: Woody erect shrub with long prominent spike inflorescences.

**Foliage**: Opposite leaves are elliptic to ovate with dentate leaf margin (4 - 11 cm long).

**Stems**: Woody stem has tan bark with linear-shaped lenticels.

**Flowers**: Blue to purple flowers have a white throat and 5 lobes (1.3 cm wide). They are arranged on a 15 - 40 cm long terminal spike inflorescence at the stem tip which has stalkless flowers held along one main axis. Only about 2 - 3 flowers are open at a time on the spike, lasting for one day and replaced by a new set the next day. The inflorescence blooms in this manner for several weeks.

  

**Habitat**&nbsp;:  
Found in tropical environments with a distinct dry season. Occurs along seashores and roadsides, as well as in disturbed areas, coconut plantations and mango groves. In Africa and Southeast Asia, this species is considered a weed in rice fields and pastures.

  

**Cultivation**&nbsp;:  
Plant in well-drained, fertile soil enriched with compost. To prevent excessive establishment of new seedlings, remove spent flowers before they set seed.

**Ethnobotanical Uses**&nbsp;:  
Food (Herb &amp; Spice) Medicinal : In Nigeria, Snakeweed is traditionally used to treat diabetes and fever. In West Africa, the juice from the plant is used to treat cataract and sores on childrenâ€™s ears. In Brazil, fresh leaf is crushed and applied on ulcers.
