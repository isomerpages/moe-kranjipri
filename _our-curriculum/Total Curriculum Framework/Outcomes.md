<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<p>In Kranji Primary School, we anchor our Student Outcomes on our School
Vision – Joyful Learners, Gracious Citizens, Champions in Life.&nbsp; We
have further elaborated on our Student Outcomes through Learning Dispositions
which are derived from MOE’s Framework for 21st Century Competencies (21CC)
and Student Outcomes (<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies</a>).</p>
