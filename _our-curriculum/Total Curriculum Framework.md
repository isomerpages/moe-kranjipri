<p>The KPS Total Curriculum Framework (2023) provides a coherent overview
of the school’s collective efforts to nurture future-ready learners.&nbsp;
At the heart of the Framework is the vision of the school to nurture Joyful
Learners, Gracious Citizens and Champions in Life.&nbsp; This is further
elaborated through our Student Outcomes, which are anchored on MOE’s 21st
Century Competencies (21CC).&nbsp; In order to deliver these outcomes,
the four core attributes of Values, Skills, Knowledge and Attitudes are
defined, as well as the accompanying key initiatives to develop these attributes.</p>
