<p>It is my honour to serve as the sixth Principal of&nbsp;Kranji Primary
School (KPS). I am grateful for the strong foundations laid by my predecessors
and our dedicated staff and am committed to building on their good work
as we continue to grow a school that our students and staff are proud to
call our second home.</p>
<p>Our philosophy, <strong><em>Every Kranjian Matters and Deserves the Best</em></strong>,
resonates with me. It reflects our commitment to ensuring that each student
and staff member is seen, heard, valued, loved and accepted for who they
are. This philosophy drives everything we do, making the growth and well-being
of our students and staff central to the work we do each day. Student and
staff voice and agency matter deeply to us, as we believe that empowered
individuals are more motivated, engaged and committed to learning, growth
and innovation.</p>
<p>This philosophy anchors our vision of nurturing <strong><em>Joyful Learners, Gracious Citizens and Champions in Life</em></strong>,
our&nbsp;mission of <strong><em>Nurturing Minds, Engaging Hearts, Building Character</em></strong> and
our&nbsp;ReCIPe values (<strong><u>Re</u></strong>silience, <strong><u>Re</u></strong>sponsibility, <strong><u>C</u></strong>ompassion, <strong><u>I</u></strong>ntegrity,
Res<strong><u>Pe</u></strong>ct) that shape who we are as a school community.
We see learning as an&nbsp;active, social endeavour—one that is meaningful,
engaging and joyful—while nurturing strong values and developing the&nbsp;21st
century competencies&nbsp;our students need for life and lifelong learning.</p>
<p>We believe that every child can learn and is capable of being his/her
best self. Learning is designed to bring out the best in our students and
empower them to discover their strengths, pursue their passions and contribute
to their community and nation. This is realised through our KPS ExCITE
Learning Approach -- <strong><u>Ex</u></strong>periential learning, <strong><u>C</u></strong>haracter-focused
education, <strong><u>I</u></strong>nquiry-based learning, <strong><u>T</u></strong>echnology-mediated
learning and Positive <strong><u>E</u></strong>ducation-driven -- supported
by student ownership and agency in a caring and enabling environment. Through
authentic learning experiences, students learn by doing, asking questions,
solving problems and reflecting on their growth. Character development
is woven intentionally into school life, while technology is used purposefully
to enhance learning, not replace it. Grounded in Positive Education and
guided by our&nbsp;Student Well-being Framework, we equip our students
with the skills to build resilience and healthy relationships and create
safe, supportive environments where children feel secure to take risks,
make mistakes and learn from them.</p>
<p>What makes Kranji Primary special is our caring culture. Stepping into
our school, one can feel the warm and welcoming environment.&nbsp; Our
school is a supportive and inclusive community where staff, students and
parents work together to bring out the best in our students. Our dedicated
staff care about each child’s growth and go the extra mile for their students.
They work collaboratively to design engaging lessons, provide timely support
and celebrate each child’s effort and progress. Our staff care for and
look out for one another, and this strong sense of collegiality is at the
heart of our school’s positive culture that shapes our students’ experiences.</p>
<p>It takes a village to raise a child and our school believes in enlisting
the entire village to support our students’ growth and well-being.&nbsp;
Our students will flourish when there is strong school-parent-community
partnership, underpinned by shared values and goals. We value the close
collaboration with our&nbsp;Parent Support Group,&nbsp;School Advisory
Committee, alumni and community and industry partners. These partnerships
provide a strong support network, enrich our students’ learning experiences
and offer diverse opportunities that extend learning beyond the classroom
and school.</p>
<p>Our staff and I are excited about new possibilities as we prepare to move
to our Tengah campus in&nbsp;<strong>2028.</strong> &nbsp;Building on our
KPS ExCITE Learning Approach, our new campus is designed to facilitate
experiential, inquiry-based learning and transform learning into an adventure.
Our architects have designed learning spaces that encourage exploration,
discovery and collaborative learning.&nbsp; Students will navigate different
learning landscapes, each designed to spark curiosity and promote meaningful
interaction with their peers and environment. The Tengah Garden district,
where the school will be located, will feature a 20-hectare park with a
forest amphitheatre, water bodies, and community farmways. Designed in
harmony with Tengah’s identity as Singapore’s first “Forest Town,” our
campus will include green corridors, outdoor learning spaces and biophilic
design elements that connect students with the natural environment and
reflect the Tengah community's commitment to sustainable and nature-centric
living.</p>
<p>We look forward to partnering you in nurturing <strong><em>Joyful Learners, Gracious Citizens and Champions in Life</em></strong> --
each one valued, supported and inspired to be their best selves.</p>
