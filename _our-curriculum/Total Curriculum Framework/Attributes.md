<p><u>Executive Functioning Skills</u>
</p>
<p>For our Lower Primary students, Executive Functioning Skills (EFS) have
been identified as pre-requisite skills necessary in every child in order
for learning and engagement to take place.&nbsp; Executive functioning
skills also equip students with strategies that help them to manage their
personal behaviour as well as interact in an appropriate manner with teachers
and peers. &nbsp;Four EFS clusters have been selected that are deemed most
relevant to our lower primary students – Memory, Organisation, Emotion
and Thinking.&nbsp; These are natural upstream articulations of the 7 Habits
that are deemed to be more accessible for Lower Primary students.&nbsp;
Bite-sized packages for Primary 1 and 2 have been created, with emphasis
on allowing our students to experience EFS through hands-on activities
with their peers and teachers.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attitudes</strong>
</p>
<p>In KPS, we hope to actively cultivate and encourage our students to have
a Growth Mindset. We want our students to relish challenges, embrace their
mistakes as part of their learning process, value the importance of effort,
respond carefully to feedback and take inspiration from others. This is
in line with our school values of Resilience and Responsibility. These
learning objectives are articulated through the 6 key messages below and
are consistently reinforced to our students throughout their six years
in the school.</p>
