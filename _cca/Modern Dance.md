##### **Introduction**

  

Modern Dance CCA members take part in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation held biennially. Besides the opportunity to take part in the Arts Presentation at national level, students are also given the opportunity to participate in school and community-based events such as the school-based Year-End Prize Giving Ceremony and community events organised by Yew Tee Citizensâ€™ Consultative Committee (CCC), among others.
