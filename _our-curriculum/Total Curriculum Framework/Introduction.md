<p>The KPS Total Curriculum Framework provides a coherent overview of the
school’s collective efforts to nurture future-ready learners.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Framework is the vision of the school to nurture Joyful
Learners, Gracious Citizens and Champions in Life.</p>
<p>This is further elaborated through our Student Outcomes, which takes guidance
from MOE’s Framework for 21st Century Competencies (21CC) and Student Outcomes
(<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies</a>).</p>
<p>In order to deliver these outcomes, the four core attributes of Values,
Skills, Knowledge and Attitudes are defined, as well as the accompanying
key initiatives to develop these attributes.</p>
<p>The EXCITE Learning Approach outlines how learning is designed, curated
and enacted in the school daily.</p>
<p>This is supported by an environment that is caring and enabling, promotes
student ownership &amp; agency, and values student centricity.</p>
