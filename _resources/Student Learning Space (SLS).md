At Kranji Primary School, we believe in helping every child find joy in learning and equip our students with the skill to leverage on technology to become future-ready champions in life.

  

As part of Ministry of Education’s (MOE) commitment to nurture future-ready learners, an online learning platform known as the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) has been developed and rolled out in 2018 by MOE. The SLS is an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources for all students to learn anytime, anywhere, collaboratively and at their own pace. With the SLS, students can take greater ownership of their learning and pick up skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning.       

  
Teachers will also use the SLS to complement classroom teaching and learning through designing meaningful lessons for students to explore and work collaboratively as well as facilitate students to learn at their own pace.   The Singapore SLS is collectively shaped by teachers and students. Taking into consideration their ideas and feedback on the resources and tools, the system is developed iteratively to stay dynamic and responsive.  
  

#### **Student's Username & Password** 


Students have been informed of their SLS username and password. **P1 to P3** students have their usernames and password printed in card form and attached to their student handbook , while P4 to P6 students have their username and password recorded in their handbook in the account information page.   
  
The username of SLS is made up of students' name and Birth Certificate (BC) number.  For example, if your name is **June C**han Mei Li,   and your BC number is T123**4567A**, then your SLS username is: **JUNEC4567A
