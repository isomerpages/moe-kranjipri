**School Creed**  
  
We, the students of KPS,<br>
pledge to be exemplary in character at all times.  
We will respect ourselves and others  
and be responsible for our learning and actions.  
We will show care, uphold integrity  
and persevere in everything we do  
to achieve success.

**School Song**&nbsp;

At Kranji we learn to work and play.&nbsp;<br>Making the most of each new day.<br>Giving our best in all that we do.<br>Living our values every day.<br>It's here where we aspire,&nbsp; to be joyful learners.<br>
Strive to be, gracious citizens.<br>
Give our best, to be champions in life every day.<br>
It's here where we belong, in this family.<br>
We'll learn and play,&nbsp; with our friends and teachers.<br>
Do our best, And we'll live up to our promise.<br>
Through knowledge and practice we'll succeed.<br>
Following faithfully our creed.<br>
Working together hand in hand.<br>
Showing our love for KPS.
