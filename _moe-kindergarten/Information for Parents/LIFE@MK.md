**Leading and Inspiring Families of Early Learners @ MOE Kindergarten (LIFE@MK)**  

LIFE@MK is a series of workshops conducted by MK educators for parents to encourage greater family involvement in children’s learning and holistic development. The workshops are customised for families and they provide practical tips and advice on how you can support your child’s learning at home.

The workshops focus on the following 4 topics:

•       Holistic development

•       Language development

•       How children learn

•       Supporting children in transition to primary school

The workshops draw on the children's learning experiences in the MOE Kindergarten and seeks to help parents understand approaches that are appropriate for their children's holistic development.
